# Doomscroller Public Showcase 

Welcome to the official repository for Doomscroller, a fast-paced, action-packed game currently in development. This project is a public showcase of my journey in creating the game, where players navigate through an endless, ever-changing digital landscape while battling obstacles and foes. As the game evolves, youâ€™ll find updates, source code, and all the latest features added to the experience.

Feel free to explore the code, or just follow along as I build and refine the game. Contributions and feedback are always welcome!


## Getting started

Each folder will have a readme inside of it, this readme will have images and detailed explaitions on the progress update.
